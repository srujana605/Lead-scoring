A telephone number is selected at random from a directory. Suppose 
X
 denote the last digit of selected telephone number. Find the probability that the last digit of the selected number is 6


P
(
X
=
6
)
=
1
/
3


P
(
X
=
6
)
=

P
(
X
=

A telephone number is selected at random from a directory. Suppose 
X
 denote the last digit of selected telephone number. Find the probability that the last digit of the selected number is less than 3


P
(
X
<
3
)
=
0.5


P
(
X
<
3
)
=
0.3


P
(
X
<
3
)
=
0.1


P
(
X
<
3
)
=
0.2

Correct!

A telephone number is selected at random from a directory. Suppose 
X
 denote the last digit of selected telephone number. Find the probability that the last digit of the selected number is greater than or equal to 8


P
(
X
≥
8
)
=
0.8


P
(
X
≥
8
)
=
0.2


P
(
X
≥
8
)
=
0.1


P
(
X
≥
8
)
=
0.15

Correct!

Let 
X
 denote the number appear on the top of a die. Then 
X
 the random variable take the values {1,2,3,4,5,6} and 
X
 follows the uniform distribution.

The probability mass function of random variable is
