For the following dataset determine the variance and standard deviation of the Age and Rating.

import pandas as pd

#Create a Dictionary of series
d = {'Name':pd.Series(['Emma','James','Ricky','Vera','Steve','Smith','Jack',
   'Eva','Chanchal','Gasper','Maria','Andrew']),
   'Age':pd.Series([19,26,25,33,30,29,23,34,40,55,25,46]),
   'Rating':pd.Series([4.29,3.24,3.98,3.56,1.20,2.66,3.8,3.78,2.98,4.80,4.10,3.65])}

#Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(d)

STD : Age = 10.405 and Rating = 0.926


VAR : Age = 8.265 and Rating = 1.345


VAR : Age = 108.265 and Rating = 0.857


STD : Age = 11.402 and Rating = 0.996

Correct!

Computing the variance for the Datasaurus Dozen Dataset

The "Datasaurus Dozen" dataset contains 13 datasets, each with a different shape but the same summary statistics. Import the datasaurus.csv using pandas as df.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can compute the variance for each dataset.

Select the correct statements.


The variance is similar for star and dots set


All the answer are incorrect


The variance is almost similar for all the dataset


The highest variance is for the Dino dataset

Correct!

Find the standard deviation of the average temperatures recorded over a five-day period last winter

temperature= [18, 22, 19, 25, 12]


94.80


4.35


23.7

Correct!

What happens to a variance or standard deviation when a constant is added? What if the variance and standard deviation is multiplied by a constant.


Variability increase when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.


Variability stays the same when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.


Variability decrease when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.

Correct!
