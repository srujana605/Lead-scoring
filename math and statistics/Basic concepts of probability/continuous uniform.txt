Bus delay: Example with python
Let's simulate the dataset related to bus delays using a uniform distribution involves generating random data that is evenly spread out across a certain range. This means that every value within the specified range is equally likely to occur. Below is an example of how you might structure and generate such a dataset using Python's numpy library for the simulation. This example assumes you want to simulate delays for 100 buses on a particular route.

Assumptions
Delays range from 1 to 5 minutes.
We want to simulate delays for 100 bus instances.
The dataset includes bus ID, scheduled time, actual arrival time, and delay in minutes.
Let's run the following code in your notebook:

# Simulating the dataset 
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
bus_delay = pd.DataFrame({
    'Bus Trip ID': range(1, 101),
    'Delay Time': np.round(np.random.uniform(1, 5, 100), 2)
})

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot the histogram for Delay Time column in bus_delay DataFrame
sns.histplot(bus_delay["Delay Time"], kde=False, color='darkgreen', stat='density', linewidth=0)

# Adding a horizontal line at y=1/4 (25% probability)
plt.axhline(1 / 4, color="red", linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Remove left and bottom spines to eliminate the box just for better visual
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel("Bus delay in minutes", fontsize=14, color='darkgreen')
plt.ylabel("Density", fontsize=14, color='darkgreen')  
plt.title("Data Distribution", fontsize=18, color='darkgreen')

# Set the color of tick labels on both axes
plt.xticks(color='orange')
plt.yticks(color='orange')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Graphical representation of Uniform Distribution would appear as a flat, constant line, indicating that each value has the same chance of being observed. Looking at our graph, it’s evident that it doesn’t precisely form a rectangle. However, we can still consider it as uniform & suitable for analysis and further work.

Now, we will compute the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) using the uniform.cdf and uniform.pdf functions, respectively.

from scipy.stats import uniform
# Define the parameters of the uniform distribution
a = 1 # Lower bound
b = 5 # Upper bound

# Calculate the CDF & PDF for x<=2.44
x = 2.44
cdf_value = uniform.cdf(x, loc=a, scale=(b-a))

pdf_value = uniform.pdf(x, loc=a, scale=(b-a))

# Print the results
print(f"The CDF for x={x} in the uniform distribution is: {cdf_value}")

print(f"The PDF in the uniform distribution is: {pdf_value}")
Now, let’s plot the CDF for the value 2.44.

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# extracting Delay Time column
delay_data = bus_delay["Delay Time"]
highlight_value = 2.44

# Create bins and assigning histogram values
hist_values, bin_edges = np.histogram(delay_data, bins=30, density=True)

# Plot histogram bars & color respective bars
for edge, value in zip(bin_edges[:-1], hist_values):
    if edge <= highlight_value:
        color = '#FF6666' #red
    else:
        color = '#009900' #green
    plt.bar(edge, value, width=np.diff(bin_edges)[0], color=color, alpha=1, align='edge', edgecolor='none')

# Highlight the value 2.32 with a red dashed line
plt.axvline(highlight_value, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Add a horizontal line at y=1/4 (25% probability)
plt.axhline(1 / 4, color="red", linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

#Add 2.32 label on X axis to indicate x value
plt.text(highlight_value, 0, str(highlight_value), color='red', ha='center', va='top', fontsize=10)

# Add a text annotation for CDF value at x ≤ 2.44
plt.text(highlight_value, 0.05, "≈ CDF = 0.36", color='orange', ha='left', va='bottom', fontsize=12, rotation='vertical')


# Remove left and bottom spines to eliminate the box just for better visual
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel("Bus delay in minutes", fontsize=14, color='darkgreen')
plt.ylabel("Density", fontsize=14, color='darkgreen') 
plt.title("CDF for x≤2.32", fontsize=18, color='#FF6666')

# Set the color of tick labels on both axes
plt.xticks(color='orange')
plt.yticks(color='orange')

# Display the plot

It indicates that there is a probability of around 36% that a randomly chosen bus will experience a delay of at most 2.44 minutes.

Let's find the probability for example the delay is at least for 3.1 minutes, you can use: 
P
(
X
≥
3.1
)
=
1
−
P
(
X
<
3.1
)
 :

P
(
X
≥
3.1
)
=
1
−
P
(
X
<
3.1
)
=
1
−
(
3.1
−
1
)
/
(

−
1
)
=
0.475

We can visually represent it, where the red region corresponds to P(X≥3.1).

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# extracting Delay Time column
delay_data = bus_delay["Delay Time"]
highlight_value = 3.1

# Create bins and assigning histogram values
hist_values, bin_edges = np.histogram(delay_data, bins=55, density=True)

# Plot histogram bars
for edge, value in zip(bin_edges[:-1], hist_values):
    if edge <= highlight_value:
        color = '#009900' # green
    else:
        color = '#FF6666' # red
    plt.bar(edge, value, width=np.diff(bin_edges)[0], color=color, alpha=1, align='edge', edgecolor='none')

# Highlight the value 3.1 with a red dashed line
plt.axvline(highlight_value, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Add a horizontal line at y=1/4 (25% probability)
plt.axhline(1 / 4, color="red", linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Add a text annotation for x value on x axis
plt.text(highlight_value, 0, str(highlight_value), color='red', ha='center', va='top', fontsize=10)

# Add a text annotation for CDF value at x >= 3.1
plt.text(highlight_value, 0.05, "≈ CDF = 0.475", color='orange', ha='left', va='bottom', fontsize=12, rotation='vertical')

# Remove left and bottom spines to eliminate the box
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)

# Set labels and title
plt.xlabel("Bus delay in minutes", fontsize=14, color='darkgreen')
plt.ylabel("Density", fontsize=14, color='darkgreen')
plt.title("CDF for x≥3.1", fontsize=18, color='red')
