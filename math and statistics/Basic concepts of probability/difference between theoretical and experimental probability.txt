What best describes the relationship between theoretical and experimental probabilities as the number of trials in an experiment increases?


The experimental probability tends to converge towards the theoretical probability.


The experimental probability becomes less predictable.


The experimental probability diverges from the theoretical probability.


The theoretical probability changes to match the experimental probability.

Correct!


Practice
Let's explore another example to understand experimental probability better: rolling a die and calculating the probability of getting a specific number, say 4. This example will further demonstrate how experimental probability compares to theoretical probability with a different kind of random event.

2
Calculate the theoretical probability of rolling a 4 with a fair six-sided die.


1/4


1/6


1/2


1

Correct!


3
Now, let's simulate rolling a die multiple times and calculate the experimental probability of getting a 4.

Use the following code to simulate the experiment, repeating it 1000 times.

Use the variable experimental_probability to save the output of your experiment.

import random

def roll_die():
    """Simulate rolling a six-sided die."""
    return random.randint(1, 6)

def simulate_rolls(number_of_rolls):
    """Simulate rolling a die multiple times and calculate experimental probability of getting a 4."""
    count_of_4s = 0

    for _ in range(number_of_rolls):
        if roll_die() == 4:
            count_of_4s += 1

    experimental_probability_of_4 = count_of_4s / number_of_rolls
    return experimental_probability_of_4
Correct!

A standard deck of cards has 52 cards, divided into four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, with each suit having 13 cards (Ace through King).

Let's simulate this experiment to find the experimental probability of drawing a Heart from the deck.

Use the following code to simulate the experiment, repeating it 1000 times.

Use the variable experimental_probability to save the output of your experiment.

import random

def create_deck():
    """Create a standard 52-card deck."""
    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
    values = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace']
    deck = [{'suit': suit, 'value': value} for suit in suits for value in values]
    return deck

def draw_card(deck):
    """Draw a random card from the deck."""
    return random.choice(deck)

def simulate_draws(number_of_draws):
    """Simulate drawing a card multiple times and calculate the experimental probability of drawing a Heart."""
    heart_count = 0
    deck = create_deck()

    for _ in range(number_of_draws):
        drawn_card = draw_card(deck)
        if drawn_card['suit'] == 'Hearts':
            heart_count += 1

    experimental_probability_hearts = heart_count / number_of_draws
    return experimental_probability_hearts
Correct!
