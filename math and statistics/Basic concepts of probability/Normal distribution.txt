Normal distribution is perhaps the most frequently used statistical term after the mean.

The normal distribution was introduced by the French mathematician Abraham DeMoivre in 1733, who used it to approximate probabilities associated with binomial random variables when the binomial parameter n is large. This result was later extended by Laplace and others and is now encompassed in a probability theorem known as the central limit theorem, which is discussed in a few lesson.

Definition.

For reals −∞ < 
μ
 < ∞ and 
σ
 > 0, the normal distribution (or Gaussian distribution) denoted N(
μ
, 
σ
2
), with mean 
μ
 and variance 
σ
2
 is a continuous random variable with probability density function.

Let's simulate an example:

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# A simplistic way to do it 
x = np.linspace(-10,10,100)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
nd = norm.pdf(x)              # get the norm.pdf for x interval 
ax.plot(x,nd,label='stdv=0.05' ) 
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('pdf(x)')
ax.set_title('Normal Distribution')

Normal distribution PDF with different standard deviations

Let’s plot the probability distribution functions of a normal distribution where the mean has different standard deviations.

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.linspace(-10,10,100)
stdvs = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
for s in stdvs:
    ax.plot(x, norm.pdf(x,scale=s), label='stdv=%.1f' % s)

ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('pdf(x)')
ax.set_title('Normal Distribution')
ax.legend(loc='best', frameon=True)
ax.set_ylim(0,0.45)
ax.grid(True)

Some usefull results concerning a normal distribution are summarized bellow. For any normal distribution,

P
(
μ
−
σ
<
X
<
μ
+
σ
)
=
0.6827

P
(
μ
−
2
σ
<
X
<
μ
+
2
σ
)
=
0.9545

P
(
μ
−
3
σ
<
X
<
μ
+
3
σ
)
=
0.9973

Almost 68% of the data falls within a distance of one standard deviation from the mean on either side and 95% within two standard deviations.

Also, from the symmetry fo 
f
(
x
)
,
P
(
X
>
μ
)
=
P
(
X
<
μ
)
=
0.5

If 
X
 is a normal random variable with parameters 
μ
 = 8 and 
σ
 = 3.

We illustrate the normal distribution and the required area in the Figure below. The area under the curve for the interval 
(
μ
−
σ
,
μ
+
σ
)
is shaded.

x_min = 0.0
x_max = 16.0

mean = 8.0 
std = 3.0

x = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 100)

y = norm.pdf(x,mean,std)

plt.plot(x,y, color='black')

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# fill area 1

pt1 = mean + std
plt.plot([pt1 ,pt1 ],[0.0,norm.pdf(pt1 ,mean, std)], color='black')

pt2 = mean - std
plt.plot([pt2 ,pt2 ],[0.0,norm.pdf(pt2 ,mean, std)], color='black')

ptx = np.linspace(pt1, pt2, 10)
pty = norm.pdf(ptx,mean,std)

plt.fill_between(ptx, pty, color='#0b559f', alpha=0.5)

The Standard Normal Distribution
Definition

A normal random variable with

ϕ

Let's calculate the Z-SCORE for an example.

mu, sigma = 10, 0.05
x = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 100000)
# Calculate stats using single sample
sample_mean = np.mean(x)
sample_stdev = np.var(x)**0.5
# Calculate standard error
std_error = sample_stdev/(x.shape[0])**0.5
# Infer distribution using single sample
z = (x-sample_mean) / std_error

# Plot histogram of inferred distribution
group_labels = ['The Standard Normal Distribution']
colors = ['magenta']

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
             # get the norm.pdf for x interval 
ax.hist(z) 
ax.set_xlabel('z')
ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
ax.set_title('Standard Normal Distribution')
