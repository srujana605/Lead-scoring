Write a function double_number(num) that returns twice the value of num. For example, double_number(5) should return 10.

Correct!


2
Sum and Average

Write a function sum_and_average(num1, num2) that returns the sum and average of two numbers. For example, sum_and_average(5, 10) should return (15, 7.5). The average should be a floating-point number.

Correct!

Document the Function

Write the function sum_and_difference(num1, num2) that returns the sum and difference of two numbers. For example, sum_and_difference(5, 10) should return (15, -5). The function should also have a docstring that describes what it does.

Write the below docstring for the function:

This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum and difference.

Parameters:
- num1: The first number.
- num2: The second number.

Returns:
- A tuple containing the sum and difference of the two numbers.
Expected outcome:

If we check the docstring of the function sum_and_difference using sum_and_difference.__doc__, it should return the above docstring like this:

This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum and difference.

Parameters:
- num1: The first number.
- num2: The second number.

Returns:
- A tuple containing the sum and difference of the two numbers.
Correct!

Type Checking

Define a function is_integer(num) that returnsTrue if the input num is an integer and False otherwise. For example, is_integer(5) should return True, and is_integer(5.5) should return False.

Correct!
