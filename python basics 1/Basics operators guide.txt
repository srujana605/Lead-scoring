Correct!

8
Calculate the mean of everyone's age at the party!

Alice is throwing a birthday party and wants to calculate the mean of everyone's age present in her birthday party. The age of people are stored in a list called, age_list.Calculate the average age using the arithmetic operators and store the result in a variable called avg_age.

Correct!


9
Find the missing operators!

For the given values of a and b, find the correct arithmetic operators that can replace the X and Y in the expression given in the jupyter notebook, such that the value of c = 25.

Also write operator used in place of X and Y.

Correct!


10

Correct!


14
Which of the following expression would result in True?


(True or False) or not (False or False)


(True or False) and (False or False)


(True or False) and not (False or False)


not(True or False)

Correct!


15
Fix the logical error in the code so it calculates the remainder when 100 is divided by 7.

Correct!


16
Decode the Logic!

Why does the following statement output Default on being executed?

print({} or "Default")

Because {} is truthy, so Python skips Default.


Because the or operator always returns the second operand.


Because {} is falsy, so Python evaluates and returns Default.


Because Default is explicitly specified in the statement.

Correct!


17
Why does the following statement output hello on being executed?

print(5 and 'hello')

Because 5 is falsy, so Python evaluates and returns hello.


Because hello is explicitly specified in the statement.


Because the and operator returns the last operand when both operands are truthy.


Because the and operator always returns the second operand.

Correct!
